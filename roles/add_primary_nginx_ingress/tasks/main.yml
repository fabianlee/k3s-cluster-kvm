# originally, was getting manifest live from github, but needed to do some replacements
# including adding labels for prometheus scraping, so much easier to locally template
#
# OTHERWISE would have needed to use yq to modify the Deployment->Daemonset
# yq '. | select(.kind == "Deployment") | (.kind)="DaemonSet" | (.spec.template.metadata.labels) += {"prometheus.io/scrape":"true"} | (.spec.template.metadata.labels) += {"prometheus.io/port":"9093"}' nginx-deploy.yaml
#
# and then pull out the other part of the manifest unchanged
# yq '. | select(.kind != "Deployment")' nginx-deploy.yaml
